# sinkhole

Hi there! This is my study note on **DNS sinkholing**, created for my _Security in Computing_ presentation at Seattle University, taught by Professor Zhiju Yang.

In this repo, you’ll find:

- How DNS is used as a defensive tool
    
- Two real-world case studies
    
- A short demo of sinkholing in action
    
- And, to wrap it up, a walkthrough on setting up your own **Pi-hole** at home for safer, cleaner, and overall better browsing. -> [pi hole set up](https://github.com/BoPann/pi-hole-set-up)
    

Let's dive in! 🚀
