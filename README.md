# sinkhole

Hi there! This is my study note on **DNS sinkholing**, created for my _Security in Computing_ presentation at Seattle University, taught by Professor Zhiju Yang.

In this repo, you’ll find:

- How DNS is used as a defensive tool (sinkhole) -> [sinkhole overview](sinkhole%20overview)
    
- Two real-world case studies
	- [Case study 1 – Microsoft Conficker (MS08-067)](Case%20study%201%20–%20Microsoft%20Conficker%20(MS08-067).md)
	- [Case study 2 – GAMEOVER Zeus](Case%20study%202%20–%20GAMEOVER%20Zeus.md)
	-  [What did the smart guys to to resolve this? ](solution.md)
- A short demo of sinkholing in action
	- [demo](demo)
    
- And, to wrap it up, a walkthrough on setting up your own **Pi-hole** at home for safer, cleaner, and overall better browsing. -> [pi hole set up](https://github.com/BoPann/pi-hole-set-up)

Lastly, this is the official pihole github repo: https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole

Let's dive in! 🚀
